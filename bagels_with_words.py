I am thinking of a {self.word_length}-letter word.
Lower case. Not a plural. Try to guess what it is.
Here are some clues:

    When I say:   That means:
    Pico          Letter is correct but in the wrong position.
    Fermi         Letter is correct and in the right position.
    Bruno         Letter is not in the secret word.
    Bagels        No letter is correct.

For example, if the secret word was "rumba" and your guess was "raspy",
the clues would be "Fermi Pico Bruno Bruno Bruno".''')
